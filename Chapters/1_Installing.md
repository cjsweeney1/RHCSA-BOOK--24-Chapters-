32-bit RHEL does not support virtualization
3. You want to install a minimal system. How much RAM do you need? 
512MB 
4. Why is it a good idea to have Internet access on all servers you are installing? 
By default, updates and installation of additional software packages requires Internet connectivity.
5. You want to install a  virtual machine on a computer that does not have an optical disk drive. What is the easiest alternative to perform the installation? 
Use an ISO image.
